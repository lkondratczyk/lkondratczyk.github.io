		<h1>The Ethical Issues That Come With Self-Driving Cars</h1>
		<div>
			<p>	When software developers program the self driving car, they will actually have to program the software
				to kill during an event when fatality is inevitable. The main problem with that is they can potentially have full
				control of the decision making process. Of course we, as society, cannot allow this to happen.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Challenges software designers face:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Accident events cannot just be hard-coded.</li>
				<li>AI needs to be able to "think".</li>
				<li>Software developers need a common moral ground to base the AI's logic on.
				<li>How to find the moral ground? Let's vote on it</li>
				<li>Voting bias</li>

	<h2>The Transition Into The World of Self-Driving Cars</h2>
		<div>
			<p>	As self-driving cars become the norm in our society, there will be a transition of people ditching normal, traditional
				cars for self-driving cars.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Slow process</li>
				<li>SD cars able to tell the difference</li>
			</ul>
			<p>	Levels of vehicle automation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Level 0: No-Automation</li>
				<li>Level 1: Function-specific Automation</li>
				<li>Level 2: Combined Function Automation</li>

			<h1>The Benefits and Implications of Self-Driving Car Networks</h1>
			<h2>Self driving cars offer many tempting advantages.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Gated intersections become a thing of the past - computers can guide vehicles between the spaces of others in cross traffic.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Computers could effectively manage a smaller distance between cars at higher speeds, increasing freeway capacity and decreasing traffic.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>These advantages are only fully realized if all cars are self driving, and all are on a common communication network.</li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
			<h3>This video shows what these intersections might look like-</h3>
			<h1><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufK2XRGUjuc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></h1>
			<h3>This video explains how the protocol to control such an intersection has already been created-</h3>
			<h1><p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yD09YjWKh8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></h1>
			<h2>Who would be responsible for maintaining such a system?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Such a network would have to be centralized in order for all cars to communicate.</li>
				<p></p>
				<li>Having one company be responsible for this means handing them a monopoly on the service.</li>
				<p></p>
				<li>Homeland security poses another obstacle to private ownership of the network.</li>
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Millions of daily commuters would have their safety depend on the network.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>The shut-down of transportation systems would be an economic catastrophe.</li>
					<p></p>
				</ul>
				<li>The government would have to be responsible for the network to address these concerns.</li>
				<p></p>
			</ul>
			<h2>The existence of a government-run transportation network has serious implications.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Supreme Court has already unanimously ruled against location-based tracking without a warrant.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href='http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/story/2012-01-23/supreme-court-GPS/52754354/1'>Supreme Court Ruling on GPS Tracking</a></li>
					<blockquote>"...reasonable expectations of privacy [are] violated by the long-term monitoring of the movements of [vehicles]."</blockquote>
					<blockquote>"...five justices suggested in concurring statements that a warrant might similarly be needed for prolonged surveillance through smartphones or other devices with GPS capabilities."</blockquote>
				</ul>
				<p></P>
				<li>We can't be on an interconnected network without signing away our right have our location known.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Would the government and law enforcement take advantage of this and keep track of our exact location and habits?</li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
			<h2>They've already done everything they can to get around this law.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>License plate scanning technology has been around for a long time.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Law enforcement has combined this technology with surveillance systems to create dragnet tracking and massive databases of people's movements.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href='https://www.aclu.org/feature/you-are-being-tracked'>ACLU article</a> on how local law enforcement currently employs this technology.</li>
						<blockquote>"In our society, it is a core principle that the government does not invade people’s privacy and collect information about citizens’ innocent activities just in case they do something wrong."</blockquote>
					<li><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/homeland-security-is-seeking-a-national-license-plate-tracking-system/2014/02/18/56474ae8-9816-11e3-9616-d367fa6ea99b_story.html'>Washington Post article</a> on Federal government plans to centralize the process.</li>
						<blockquote>"...the database could easily contain more than 1 billion records and could be shared with other law enforcement agencies, raising concerns that the movements of ordinary citizens who are under no criminal suspicion could be scrutinized."</blockquote>
				</ul>
				<p></P>
				<li>This type of tracking is very limited - it requires massive storage to maintain, and doesn't give accurate real-time location of individuals.</li>
				<p></P>

	<h1>What Self-Driving Cars Means for... </h1>
	<h2>Insurance</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The need for insurance will decrease because as we move into self-driving cars the liability shifts from driver to manufacturer of the vehicle, the software developer, and any third parties related.</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>“If nondiscretionary-communicative vehicles became mandatory (as the introduction of either the interactive or remote-controlled models might require), there would be no need for private insurance, since all liability for AVs would be transferred to manufacturers” </li>
		<p></P>
	</ul>
	<h3> Individual &rarr; Manufacturer </h3>
	<center><img id="imodel" src="images/imodelsafety.jpg"></center>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. The technology uses a sensor behind the badge to detect the proximity of vehicles in front.
		</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>A camera links to the radar to look for pedestirans at the edge of the road</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>The driver can use controls on the steering wheel to activate the system and control the speed</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>A display on the dashboard shows the speed</li>
		<p></P>
	</ol>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Licensing</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The best part of turning 16, besides later curfews and getting halfway through high school is getting your license.</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said that Google’s self-driving cars will now be considered legal drivers in the eyes of the law </li>
		<p></P>
		<li>At this point self-driving cars will need to have a licensed driver in the car, to manually drive the car in the event of an emergency, until self-driving cars are proven safe. </li>
		<p></P>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Business and Productivity </h2>
	<p></p>
	<h3> Rideshare and Taxi Services </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Try to imagine a future where Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Yellowcab evolve into self-driving taxi services lowering costs by almost 55% </li>
		<p></P>
		<li> Google, Ford Motor Co , Uber, Volvo and Lyft recently formed a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market. </li>
		<p></P>
		<li>Google, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, and Mercedes looking to copy the Uber/Lyft business model to profit off of their self-driving services. While Uber partners with Carnegie Melon to develop its own autonomous vehicle.</li>
		<blockquote>"...Uber has just revealed that it is giving $5.5 million to the university to support a new robotics faculty chair as well as sponsor three graduate fellowships."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"...goal to make transportation as reliable as running water"</blockquote>

	</ul>

	<h3> Courier and Semi </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A recent study, shows that people are using courier services more than ever. With developments such as Postmates, Door Dash, and Taskrabbit people can hire other people to do just about anything on their smart devices. </li>
		<p></P>
		<li> Amazon moving to drones for shipment, but a company in the UK &#40; coming to the US soon &#41; is using self-driving technology to get your errands done without a hassle.</li>
		<p></p>
	</ul>
	<center><img id="imodel" src="images/starship1.jpg"></center>
	<p></p>
	<blockquote>"The robots can hold about two shopping bags’ worth of cargo—enough for any missing essentials, or the sorts of things Amazon hopes to ship through the air—and can travel for 2 to 3 hours on a single charge."</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"...are in constant contact with a human dispatcher who can take over if needed. The robots weigh about 40 lbs., and their cargo bays are can be opened only by the person waiting on the delivery. If someone tries to steal from the bots, they call the police for help and film the incident. "</blockquote>
	<p></p>

		<li>The trucking industry as also moved into self-driving semi trucks </li>

		<li> The technology offers a number of advantages to this industry </li>
		<p></p>
		<blockquote>"An autonomous system never gets tired, never gets distracted. It is always on 100 percent."</blockquote>
		<p></p>
		<li>Proponents of autonomous vehicles also contend the technology will reduce fuel consumption and emissions and improve roadway utilization.
		</li>
		<h3> Productivity, 2040 and Beyond </h3>

	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Car designs will fundamentally change with forward-facing seats and touch screens, mirrors and pedals would no longer be necessary. Now we can text, make phone calls, respond to emails, read, sleep, do homework, etc.</li>
		<p></P>
		<li>Structurally - more space. Less buildings built to accomodate people &#40;in reference to cars&#41; i.e parking structures </li>
		<p></p>
		<blockquote>"that means we get back 5.7 billion square meters of space—enough to hold the Grand Canyon and then some. "</blockquote>
		<p></p>
		<li>Our entire idea of car ownership could change. Now we buy multiple cars to allow families to be as efficent and indenpendent as possible. With self driving cars, multiple people can use the same car while still doing different tasks.</li>
		<p></P>
		<h3>BUT !</h3>
		<li> Loss of jobs ! Many people depend on their ability to drive and knowledege of cars to earn a living. With fully autonomous cars, semitrucks, and busses more than 20 million people are at risk of losing their jobs.</li>
		<p></P>
		<li> With a decrease in car accidents, what does that mean for the health/medical industry? car repair industry?</li>
