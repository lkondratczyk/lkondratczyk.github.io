        <h1>What Self-Driving Cars Means for... </h1>
			<h2>Insurance</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The need for insurance will decrease because as we move into self-driving cars the liability shifts from driver to manufacturer of the vehicle, the software developer, and any third parties related.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>“If nondiscretionary-communicative vehicles became mandatory (as the introduction of either the interactive or remote-controlled models might require), there would be no need for private insurance, since all liability for AVs would be transferred to manufacturers” </li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
<h3> Individual &rarr; Manufacturer </h3>

<ol type="1">
				<li>Autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. The technology uses a sensor behind the badge to detect the proximity of vehicles in front.
</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>A camera links to the radar to look for pedestirans at the edge of the road</li>
				<p></P>
<li>The driver can use controls on the steering wheel to activate the system and control the speed</li>
				<p></P>
<li>A display on the dashboard shows the speed</li>
				<p></P>
			</ol>
<p></P>
<h2>Licensing</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The best part of turning 16, besides later curfews and getting halfway through high school is getting your license.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said that Google’s self-driving cars will now be considered legal drivers in the eyes of the law </li>
				<p></P>
<li>At this point self-driving cars will need to have a licensed driver in the car, to manually drive the car in the event of an emergency, until self-driving cars are proven safe. </li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
<p></P>
<h2>Business and Productivity </h2>
<p></p>
<h3> Rideshare and Taxi Services </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to imagine a future where Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Yellowcab evolve into self-driving taxi services lowering costs by almost 55% </li>
				<p></P>
				<li> Google, Ford Motor Co , Uber, Volvo and Lyft recently formed a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market. </li>
				<p></P>
<li>Google, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, and Mercedes looking to copy the Uber/Lyft business model to profit off of their self-driving services. While Uber partners with Carnegie Melon to develop its own autonomous vehicle. 
</li>
<blockquote>"...Uber has just revealed that it is giving $5.5 million to the university to support a new robotics faculty chair as well as sponsor three graduate fellowships."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"...goal to make transportation as reliable as running water"</blockquote>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
<h3> Courier and Semi </h3>
<ul>
				<li>A recent study, shows that people are using courier services more than ever. With developments such as Postmates, Door Dash, and Taskrabbit people can hire other people to do just about anything on their smart devices. </li>
				<p></P>
				<li> Amazon moving to drones for shipment, but a company in the UK &#40; coming to the US soon &#41; is using self-driving technology to get your errands done without a hassle.</li>
<p></p>
</ul>
<center><img id="imodel" src="starship1.jpg"></center>
<p></p>
<blockquote>"The robots can hold about two shopping bags’ worth of cargo—enough for any missing essentials, or the sorts of things Amazon hopes to ship through the air—and can travel for 2 to 3 hours on a single charge."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"...are in constant contact with a human dispatcher who can take over if needed. The robots weigh about 40 lbs., and their cargo bays are can be opened only by the person waiting on the delivery. If someone tries to steal from the bots, they call the police for help and film the incident. "</blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
				<li>The trucking industry as also moved into self-driving semi trucks </li>
				<p></P>

				<li> The technology offers a number of advantages to this industry </li>
				<p></P>
<blockquote>"An autonomous system never gets tired, never gets distracted. It is always on 100 percent."</blockquote>
<p></p>

<li>Proponents of autonomous vehicles also contend the technology will reduce fuel consumption and emissions and improve roadway utilization.
</li>

<h3> Productivity, 2040 and Beyond </h3>
<center><img id="imodel" src="productivity1.jpg"><img id="imodel" src="productivity2.jpg"></center>
<ul>
				<li> Car designs will fundamentally change with forward-facing seats and touch screens, mirrors and pedals would no longer be necessary. Now we can text, make phone calls, respond to emails, read, sleep, do homework, etc.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Structurally - more space. Less buildings built to accomodate people &#40;in reference to cars&#41; i.e parking structures </li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>"that means we get back 5.7 billion square meters of space—enough to hold the Grand Canyon and then some. "</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li>Our entire idea of car ownership could change. Now we buy multiple cars to allow families to be as efficent and indenpendent as possible. With self driving cars, multiple people can use the same car while still doing different tasks.</li>
				<p></P>
<h3>BUT !</h3>
<li> Loss of jobs ! Many people depend on their ability to drive and knowledege of cars to earn a living. With fully autonomous cars, semitrucks, and busses more than 20 million people are at risk of losing their jobs.
</li>
				<p></P>
<li> With a decrease in car accidents, what does that mean for the health/medical industry? car repair industry? 
</li>
				<p></P>
