After all, he could live anywhere		and roams the globe in search of beauty, but decidedly prefers it here. That		is why it is significant that he chooses to recommend two outstanding real		estate broker associates to his readers. Jo Ann Mermis and her partner, Wes		St. Clair, have impeccable credentials, know Montecito (and Santa Barbara		and Santa Ynez) inside and out and give the kind of personal attention many		thought had disappeared. Wes is a former banker from Kansas City, and Jo		Ann has over 25 years of experience in Santa Barbara real estate. Together, they have not only the respect of		the community but of their real estate peers and they not only know the best deals and hidden treasures on the		market but how to consummate a sale with the least amount of stress. They have great banking, club and social		contacts, too. And access to a helicopter (Wes is a pilot) to show you Santa Barbara from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view.	</p>	<p>		<a href="testimonials.html">Back to Testimonials</a><span class="dot">&middot;</span><a href="entree2.html">Continue &raquo;</a>	</p></body></html>
