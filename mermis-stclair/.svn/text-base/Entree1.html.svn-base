During that quarter century he has seen many changes, but he still values Montecito for its salubrious Mediterranean climate, great ocean and mountain setting and simpatico residents. After all, he could live anywhere and roams the globe in search of beauty, but decidedly prefers it here. That is why it is significant that he chooses to recommend two outstanding real estate broker associates to his readers. Jo Ann Mermis and her partner, Wes St. Clair, have impeccable credentials, know Montecito (and Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez) inside and out and give the kind of personal attention many thought had disappeared. Wes is a former banker from Kansas City, and Jo Ann has over 25 years of experience in Santa Barbara real estate. Together, they have not only the respect of the community but of their real estate peers and they not only know the best deals and hidden treasures on the market but how to consummate a sale with the least amount of stress. They have great banking, club and social contacts, too. And access to a helicopter (Wes is a pilot) to show you Santa Barbara from a bird's-eye view. They are the only people we know in town who take magnificent aerial photos of their listings from a chopper - just one of their innovative touches. If you have ever dreamed about a home here or a piece of property, even an office building, we urge you to call Jo Ann or Wes at (805) 879-5033 or (805) 879-8097, or check out their website, www.mermisstclair.com. Jo Ann and Wes have just sold a $25 million estate here, but they have many other listings starting in the $2-3 million range, and you'll get as much kid-glove attention on these as you would if you were a billionaire. These two gracious people are affiliated with Prudential California Realty, part of Home Services of America, a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate, so you can choose them with exceptional assurance. If they are good enough for Warren Buffet, they will be perfect for you.</font></p>		<p><font size="-2">ENTREE is published monthly by ENTREE Travel, P.O.
