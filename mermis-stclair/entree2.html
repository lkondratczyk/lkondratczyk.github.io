	</h1>

	<p>
		They are the only people we know in town who take magnificent aerial photos of their listings from a chopper
		- just one of their innovative touches. If you have ever dreamed about a home here or a piece of property,
		even an office building, we urge you to call Jo Ann or Wes at (805) 879-5033 or (805) 879-8097, or check out
		their website, www.mermisstclair.com. Jo Ann and Wes have just sold a $25 million estate here, but they have
		many other listings starting in the $2-3 million range, and youâll get as much kid-glove attention on these as
		you would if you were a billionaire. These two gracious people are affiliated with Prudential California Realty,
		part of Home Services of America, a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate, so you can choose them with exceptional
		assurance. If they are good enough for Warren Buffet, they will be perfect for you.
